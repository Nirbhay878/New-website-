    <p>Hi, I'm Nirbhay. I’m a first-year Mechatronics Engineering student at the University of Sydney, driven by curiosity and a passion for creating. My journey into tech started with just messing around and building random projects back in high school. I got into everything from basic coding to experimenting with hardware, always attending workshops and learning from what I could. That hands-on approach fueled my drive to explore new things, and over time, I’ve developed an interest in robotics, system design, and software development. Throughout this journey, I’ve been fortunate to collaborate with amazing people who’ve helped me grow and expand my perspective.</p>

    <h2>What Drives Me?</h2>
    <p>I’m passionate about understanding complex systems, and I’m always in pursuit of the next thrilling challenge. Engineering and technology give me the chance to work on practical, impactful solutions, apply my creativity, and contribute something meaningful. Someday, I hope to work on groundbreaking projects in aerospace and robotics, fields that truly inspire me and push the boundaries of what’s possible.</p>
    <p>For now, I’m focused on building a solid foundation in engineering and eagerly looking forward to connecting with others who share the same burning drive. If that sounds like you, let’s connect!</p>
